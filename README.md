## Features

- Customizable messages, reactions, commands, and roles

- Auto-removes role when user removes a reaction

- Option to use an embed to have all options in one message

## Installation

Clone this repository to your local machine.

Run the `npm install` command to install discord.js

Open `roleReact.js` with a text editor and modify the following lines: 

```JavaScript
const yourID = "158063324699951104"; //Instructions on how to get this: https://redd.it/40zgse
const setupCMD = "!createrolemessage"
const initialMessage = `**React to the messages below to receive the associated role. If you would like to remove the role, simply remove your reaction!**`;
const embedMessage = `
React to the emoji that matches the role you wish to receive.

If you would like to remove the role, simply remove your reaction!
`;
const embedFooter = "Role Reactions"; // Must set this if "embed" is set to true
const roles = ["Hacker", "Artist", "Public Relations", "Intern"];
const reactions = ["ðŸ’»", "ðŸ–Œ", "ðŸ˜ƒ", "ðŸ†•"];
const embed = false; // Set to "true" if you want all roles to be in a single embed
const embedColor = "#dd2423"; // Set the embed color if the "embed" variable is set to true
const botToken = "";
/**
 * You'll have to set this up yourself! Read more below:

 */
```

Mandatory:

- Fill in the yourID variable. You can get "yourID" in any Discord channel by typing `\@YOUR NAME`. For me, it would be `\@Night`.

- Change roles the to ones that are in your server.

- Replace the reaction emojis with the ones of your choosing. 
**Note:** to get the value for the reaction, type `\:my_reaction` with the backslash and press enter. If done correctly, a smaller emoji should appear. Copy the small emoji into the reactions array.
 For custom emojis, follow the previous step and copy the string of numbers only (i.e. ignore text and angled brackets). Paste the string of numbers into the reactions array as you would with regular emojis.

- Set `embed` to true or false if you wish to use a single embed for all reaction roles. After that, set the text for the embed footer via the `embedFooter` variable

- Set up the bot and get a token. The [Github Wiki Page](https://github.com/reactiflux/discord-irc/wiki/Creating-a-discord-bot-&-getting-a-token) explains how to set up bots and get tokens. An image of the permissions the bot needs can be [found here](https://i.imgur.com/PFDm3pH.png). **Make sure the bot has a role/the permissions that allows it to modify other user's roles.**

Optional:

- Modify the `setupCMD` variable to display a custom setup message

- Modify `initialMessage` variable to display a custom initial message

- Modify the `embedMessage` variable to display a custom message for the embed

- Modify the `embedColor` variable to display a custom embed color

**After you have installed discord.js and made the modifications above, run the `npm start` command to start the bot!**
